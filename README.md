# 💸 Discount Calculator

This Python script calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount — but only if the discount is **20% or more**.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters the original price and discount percentage
2. If the discount is **>= 20%**, it's applied
3. Otherwise, the original price is returned
4. Invalid input is handled gracefully

## 💡 Example Output

Enter the original price: 100  
Enter the discount percentage: 25  
Discount applied! Final price: $75.00

Enter the discount percentage: 15  
No discount applied. Final price: $100.00
